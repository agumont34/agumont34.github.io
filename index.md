I am currently a **Senior Researcher** at [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/en) (Directeur de Recherche) in the Microelectronics department of  
[LIRMM](https://www.lirmm.fr/lirmm-en/) (Laboratory of Computer Science, Robotics and Microelectronics of Montpellier). Since January 2021, I am Deputy Director of [LIRMM](https://www.lirmm.fr/lirmm-en/), which is a major multi-disciplinary research center located in the South of France.

The focus of my current research is on energy-efficient and high-performance embedded systems. Different design aspects are covered, including software mechanisms, architecture, and emerging memory and communication technologies. An important challenge is to adequately address the increasing heterogeneity of the target systems in a way that guarantees their energy efficiency. This activity is conducted within the [Adaptive Computing (ADAC)](https://www.lirmm.fr/teams-en/ADAC-en/) team in [LIRMM](https://www.lirmm.fr/lirmm-en/).
